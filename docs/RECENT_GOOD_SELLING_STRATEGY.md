# Recent Good Selling Products Strategy

## Overview

The **Recent Good Selling Products Strategy** is a new strategic approach for identifying emerging products that are gaining traction in the market but haven't yet accumulated significant review counts. This strategy helps Walmart identify early-stage opportunities before they become mainstream.

## Strategy Criteria

The strategy targets products that meet the following criteria:

1. **Low Review Count**: Less than 50 reviews on Amazon
   - Indicates the product is relatively new to the market
   - Suggests early-stage adoption

2. **High Sales Volume**: More than 100 units sold in the past month
   - Demonstrates strong market demand
   - Indicates product-market fit

3. **Quality Assurance**: Rating of 4.0 or higher
   - Ensures product quality despite low review count
   - Maintains customer satisfaction standards

4. **Market Opportunity**: Not available on Walmart
   - Identifies gaps in Walmart's product portfolio
   - Represents untapped revenue potential

## Implementation

### Method Signature

```python
def recent_good_selling_products(self, max_reviews: int = 50, min_sales: int = 100) -> str:
```

### Parameters

- `max_reviews` (int, default: 50): Maximum number of reviews on Amazon
- `min_sales` (int, default: 100): Minimum sales volume in the past month

### Filter Logic

```python
filter_obj = (
    (F.reviews_count_amazon < max_reviews) &
    (F.bought_past_month_amazon > min_sales) &
    (F.rating_amazon >= 4.0) &
    (F.is_available_amazon.is_true()) &
    (F.available_for_delivery_walmart.is_false()) &
    (F.reviews_count_amazon > 0)  # Ensure some reviews exist
)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from walmart_strategy_queries import WalmartStrategyQueries

strategy = WalmartStrategyQueries()
snapshot_id = strategy.recent_good_selling_products()
```

### Custom Parameters

```python
# More restrictive criteria
snapshot_id = strategy.recent_good_selling_products(max_reviews=30, min_sales=200)

# Premium product focus
snapshot_id = strategy.recent_good_selling_products(max_reviews=20, min_sales=500)
```
